# CCP-BioSim Training Course: Basic MD data analysis with MDTraj
IPython (Jupyter) notebooks are a great environment in which to do exploratory analysis of MD data. This workshop illustrates how two key Python packages - *numpy* and *matplotlib* - can be used with the MD analysis package [mdtraj](http://mdtraj.org/1.9.3/) for some simple standard analysis tasks.

## Requirements
A basic knowledge of Python and MD simulation methods
